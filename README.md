# Grid-Unlock
These are the scripts and data associated with the "Grid Unlock" blogpost on perplex.city

[squarewalks.py] (../master/squarewalks.py) simulates the walks on an 8 x 8 grid

[librarywalks.py] (../master/librarywalks.py) simulates the walks from Ricky's NYC to the public library

10,000 trials were run for the dumb and smart approaches for both the 8 x 8 grid and the library

All four sets of results are in [allwalks.csv] (../master/allwalks.csv)

[walkgraphs.R] (../master/walkgraphs.R) turns that data into the histograms and also creates and graphs the combinatoric models
